## Modeling APL-Mediated Local Inhibition in the Fruit Fly Mushroom Body for Understanding Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance

Mushroom body is the learning center for most arthropods (including insects, shrimps, crabs etc.), and shares the same network structure with other learning hubs in mammals like cerebellum and hippocampus [1]. In those learning hubs, a relatively large population of neurons randomly receive combinatory inputs from different sensory channels so that the activities of ensembles of neurons represent a particular sensory context [2]. Sensory representations can be associated with specific behaviors by tuning connection strength between representation neurons and their output neurons [3]. Hence the sparse, less overlapping sensory representations in the large neuron population is critical for pattern separation and accuracy of learning [1,4]. In the Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) mushroom body, there are ~2000 Kenyon Cells which receive inputs from a random 6 out of 54 olfactory channels [5]. A giant GABAergic interneuron called APL is known essential for olfactory discrimination learning [6]. APL receives inputs from all Kenyon cells, and provides inhibition back to all Kenyon cells based on existing connectome datasets (Figure 2) [7,8]. Recent electrophysiology study shows the lateral inhibition from APL is local and not propagate to all Kenyon Cells [9]. The transcriptomics study of APL suggests that a lack of voltage gated channels for generating action potential may result in a local spreading of inhibition to Kenyon cells [10]. It is unknown how this local inhibition contributes to the sensory representations sparsity. Whatâ€™s more, as each Kenyon cell connects with multiple output neurons along its axon [11], inhibitions from APL may alter the propagation of Kenyon Cell odor responses, eventually distal output neurons may receive sparser input than proximal output neurons.
